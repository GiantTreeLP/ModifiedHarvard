# ModifiedHarvard

This repository holds the Harvard bibliography style for Microsoft Word modified by me.

Great thanks to my lecturer Uwe Kern for the template and documentation.  
Even more thanks to my peers for basically proof-reading this bibliography style.

Keep in mind that this style is in the german language but could easily be translated to English.

# Style
The style does not emphasize any part of reference but is meant to match the template from my lecturer.

A few samples:

Book:
```
Author (2018): Author, T.: About Tests in Word Processing Applications, 1., Some Press Earth 2018
```

Book excerpt:
```
Author (2018): Author, T.: About Tests in Word Processing Applications. In: T. Author Hrsg. Tests. 1., Some Press, Seiten 1-2, Earth 2018
```

Newspaper article:
```
Author (2018): Author, T.: About Tests in Word Processing Applications, Test Newspaper, I(1), Seiten 1-2
```

# Installation
Just copy the `ModifiedHarvard.xsl` file to `%appdata%\Microsoft\Bibliography\Style`.

Then select the style in Word.
