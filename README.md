Latest release: https://git.groundmc.net/GiantTree/ModifiedHarvard/releases

This repository holds the Harvard bibliography style modified by me.

Great thanks to my lecturer Uwe Kern for the template and documentation.  
Even more thanks to my peers for basically proof-reading this bibliography style.
